      '-- Start with cleaned and peeled russet potatoes that you have cut into 3/8-inch match sticks. Place in bowl of very cold water: keep rinsing and changing the water until the water is clear; drain thoroughly and dry with paper towels or a clean lint-free kitchen towel.\n\n -- Meanwhile, you preheat your hot oil to 350 degrees F. Place prepared taters in oil and cook about 5 minutes. They will have that blond-tone color to them. \n\n -- Note: Once you add cold potatoes to the hot oil, the temperature of your oil is going to drop - you want it to be somewhere between 330 - 325 degrees F. \n\n -- Remove from oil; drain and cool. Now - either refrigerate until ready to finish cooking, or cool completely and freeze up to 3 months. To freeze properly - place completely cooled fries in single layer on tray and place in freezer until frozen. Then bag them.\n\n -- To finish cooking - preheat your oil to 400* F. Add your cold fries (which will drop the oil temp - which is fine because you want it near the 375 degrees F. temp) and cook a few minutes until done. Lightly salt them and shake well so that the salt distributes well and they are not salty.'
